## ✨ Why FastSync?

FastSync is built for large folders and short-lived directory handoffs where speed matters, but silent mistakes are unacceptable.

- **Written in Rust**: fast native execution, predictable resource use, and a small deployment story.
- **Fast by design**: metadata-aware comparison, BLAKE3, and concurrent workers.
- **Network sync built in**: share or receive a folder once with a simple pairing code.
- **Safe by default**: no implicit deletion, dry-run support, and temporary-file overwrite writes.
- **Clear while it runs and after it finishes**: terminal progress, readable summaries for humans, and JSON for scripts.

## 🏎️ Extreme Performance

Directory sync is a mix of filesystem latency, metadata checks, hashing, and copying. FastSync keeps those stages explicit and controlled.

| Performance design        | How it helps                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rust implementation       | Native binary performance with predictable memory and CPU behavior.                                                                  |
| Metadata-aware comparison | Uses file size and modified time where they are valid content signals, while metadata synchronization stays separately configurable. |
| BLAKE3 hashing            | Uses a very fast modern hash for strong content comparison when needed.                                                              |
| Bounded worker queue      | Keeps copying concurrent without letting memory usage grow without control.                                                          |
| Direct new-file copy      | Files missing from the target are copied directly, avoiding unnecessary temporary rename overhead.                                   |

> [!NOTE]
> Fast comparison is the default. Use `--strict` when same-metadata files should still be confirmed with BLAKE3.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Preview the sync:

```bash
fastsync -n ./source ./target
```

Run it for real:

```bash
fastsync ./source ./target
```

Mirror and remove stale target files:

```bash
fastsync -n -d ./source ./target
fastsync -d ./source ./target
```

> [!CAUTION]
> `--delete` removes files from the target when they do not exist in the source. Preview with `-n -d` before the first real deletion run.

## 📦 Install

FastSync uses the Rust 2024 edition and requires Rust 1.85 or newer. With `rustup`, use the stable toolchain:

```bash
rustup default stable
rustup component add rust-src
```

## 🧭 Common Workflows

| Goal                               | Command                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Preview a sync                     | `fastsync -n ./source ./target`       |
| Sync one folder into another       | `fastsync ./source ./target`          |
| Sync and delete stale target files | `fastsync -d ./source ./target`       |
| Use strict comparison              | `fastsync --strict ./source ./target` |
| Limit worker threads               | `fastsync -t 4 ./source ./target`     |
| Output JSON for scripts            | `fastsync -o json ./source ./target`  |
| Share a folder once                | `fastsync s ./source`                 |

<summary><strong>Example: safe backup mirror</strong></summary>

```bash
# First run: inspect what would happen.
fastsync -n -d ~/Photos /mnt/backup/Photos

# Second run: apply the same operation.
fastsync -d ~/Photos /mnt/backup/Photos
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Example: fast cache mirror</strong></summary>

```bash
fastsync ./target/release ./cache/release
```

The default fast mode trusts matching metadata, then hashes only when same-size files have differing modified times or supported permissions.

## 🌐 Remote Folder Sync

Use this for a temporary handoff: send a folder to someone, or let them upload one to you. The person sharing the folder starts `share`, reads out the one-time code, and the other side runs `connect`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is one-way sync. Choose download or upload for each session; FastSync does not merge changes from both sides.

Send a folder to someone:

```bash
fastsync s ./photos
fastsync c server.example.com ./photos -c 123456
```

Let someone upload a folder to you:

```bash
fastsync s ./inbox -r
fastsync c server.example.com ./project -u -c 123456
```

What happens by default:

| Default            | Meaning                                                                 |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| share sends files  | `fastsync s ./photos` only lets the other side download.                |
| one-time code      | FastSync prints a code when sharing starts.                             |
| one successful use | The sharing side exits after one completed sync.                        |
| no server deletion | Upload clients cannot delete your files unless you explicitly allow it. |

You can omit `--code`; FastSync will prompt for it.

Common shortcuts:

| Full form                | Shortcut          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| `share` / `connect`      | `s` / `c`         |
| `--code 123456`          | `-c 123456`       |
| `--mode receive`         | `-r` or `-m r`    |
| `--direction push`       | `-u`              |
| `--delete`               | `-d`              |
| `--strict`               | no short form     |
| `--allow-delete`         | `-a`              |
| `--preserve-permissions` | `-p` or `--perms` |

Deleting extra files is always opt-in and only affects the side receiving files:

| When you choose | `--delete` can delete            | Extra requirement                |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| download        | Extra files in your local folder | None                             |
| upload          | Extra files in the shared folder | Sharing side must allow deletion |

```bash
fastsync c server.example.com ./photos -d -c 123456
fastsync s ./inbox -r -a
fastsync c server.example.com ./project -u -d -c 123456
```

By default, received files keep their modification times. Permission bits are copied only when requested:

| Option                   | Meaning                                                                                 |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--strict`               | Hash same-size local files even when metadata matches before deciding what to transfer. |
| `--no-preserve-times`    | Do not preserve source modification times on received files and directories.            |
| `--preserve-permissions` | Preserve source permission bits on received files and directories. Disabled by default. |

Without `--strict`, network sync defaults to fast comparison: matching metadata is trusted, and BLAKE3 is used only for same-size files whose metadata differs.

For auditing, the sharing side logs who connected, whether the session downloaded or uploaded, delete/metadata choices, pairing failures, file count, byte count, deleted count, and elapsed time. Use `--log-level debug` for more detail.

Technical note: one-shot network sync uses QUIC with a temporary self-signed certificate, verifies received files with BLAKE3, and writes through temporary files before replacement. Use it for short-lived sessions where both sides can confirm the address and code.

## 🛡️ Safety First By Default

| Default                  | Why it matters                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| One-way sync             | The source is the authority; the target follows it.                                                                                                    |
| No implicit deletion     | Target-only files are preserved unless `--delete` is used.                                                                                             |
| Fast comparison          | Existing files trust matching metadata by default, and use BLAKE3 only for same-size files whose metadata differs.                                     |
| Temporary-file overwrite | Existing targets are written to a temporary filename first, then renamed into place, reducing the chance of leaving a partial file after interruption. |
| Direct new-file copy     | Missing target files are copied directly, without unnecessary rename overhead.                                                                         |
| Dry-run support          | You can inspect the plan before changing anything.                                                                                                     |

## 🔍 Choose A Comparison Mode

| Mode     | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                        | Use when                                                             |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fast`   | If metadata matches, treats the file as unchanged. If metadata differs, size differences are changed immediately; same-size files are checked with BLAKE3. This is the default. | You want good speed while still hashing ambiguous same-size changes. |
| `strict` | If sizes match, checks content with BLAKE3 even when metadata also matches.                                                                                                     | You want content confirmation for every existing same-size file.     |

`--strict` is a shortcut for `--compare strict`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Fast mode can miss content changes when size, modified time, and supported permissions stay the same. Use `strict` for important data that needs content confirmation even when metadata matches.

Same-name file metadata synchronization is separate from content comparison and is enabled by default. Use `--no-sync-metadata` to skip standalone metadata updates, or `--preserve-times false` and/or `--preserve-permissions false` to narrow which metadata is preserved.

## ✅ Verification

Post-copy verification is controlled by `--verify`:

| Mode      | Behavior                                       |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `none`    | Do not verify after copying.                   |
| `changed` | Verify overwritten files. This is the default. |
| `all`     | Verify all regular source files after sync.    |

The summary reports BLAKE3 content checks in two separate counters: comparison-time checks used by `fast` or `strict`, and post-copy verifications controlled by `--verify`.
New files that do not exist in the target are copied directly and are not counted as post-copy BLAKE3 verifications.

## 📟 Progress And Logs

When running in an interactive terminal with text output, fastsync shows a bottom
progress indicator for local sync stages:

- Scanning source and target directories.
- Building the sync plan, including processed entries, planned operations, planned data, and BLAKE3 comparison count.
- Executing the sync plan.
- Full verification when `--verify all` is enabled.

Network `share` and `connect` commands also show progress for active transfer
phases:

- Sending and receiving manifests.
- Serving or requesting BLAKE3 hashes for ambiguous files.
- Planning requested files.
- Sending and receiving file streams.
- Deleting obsolete entries and applying received metadata when those phases run.

The progress UI is designed for humans at a terminal. It is automatically hidden
for JSON output, non-TTY output, `TERM=dumb`, and `NO_COLOR` environments. The
summary and JSON output continue to use stdout, while logs and progress render on
stderr so scripts can consume stdout safely.

fastsync routes tracing logs through a progress-aware writer when the progress UI
is active, so log lines and the bottom indicator can coexist without corrupting
each other. Increase `--log-level` when you need more detail; progress remains a
visual status layer and does not change sync behavior.

Running `fastsync` without arguments also prints help.

## 🧪 Development

This crate sets `edition = "2024"` in `Cargo.toml`. That is the Rust edition name, not the current calendar year; Rust editions are opt-in language compatibility milestones, and the 2024 edition remains current even when building in 2026.

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

Maintainers and coding agents should read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Is FastSync bidirectional?</strong></summary>

No. FastSync is intentionally one-way: source to target.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Will FastSync delete files by default?</strong></summary>

No. Deletion only happens when `--delete` or `-d` is provided.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Should I use <code>--strict</code>?</strong></summary>

Use it for important personal or production data where matching metadata is not enough confidence. For generated files, caches, and build outputs, the default `fast` mode is usually the better tradeoff.
